# G&L Auditor V2 — Artifact Templates (Copy-Ready)

These templates are copied into the TARGET repo's `docs/.scratch-audit/` (or `docs/plans/`) during a run — never written into the surgical-implementation skill itself.

Each section below is a self-contained template. Copy the fenced block verbatim into the named file in the run workspace, then fill the placeholders (`<...>`) and tick `[ ]` → `[x]` as each item is satisfied.

File destination per template (relative to `docs/.scratch-audit/`):

| Template | Target file |
|---|---|
| 1 | `REQUIREMENTS.md` |
| 2 | `CODEBASE-STATE.md` |
| 3 | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| 4 | `TODO.md` |
| 5 | `debrief.md` |
| 6 | `TRACEABILITY.md` |
| 7 | `SECURITY.md` |
| 8 | `RISK.md` |
| 9 | `research/SOURCES.md` |
| 10 | `research/FINDINGS.md` |
| 11 | `research/DECISIONS.md` |
| 12 | `runtime/manifest.json` |
| 13 | `runtime/state.json` |
| 14 | `runtime/events.jsonl` |

## 1. REQUIREMENTS.md

```markdown
# Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

## User request
<!-- Faithful, concise restatement of what the user asked for. Do NOT paraphrase
     away constraints or scope. Capture the original wording where possible. -->

## Functional requirements
- [ ] REQ-001. <functional capability the system must provide>
- [ ] REQ-002. <functional capability the system must provide>
- [ ] REQ-003. <functional capability the system must provide>

## Non-functional requirements
- [ ] NFR-001. <performance / security / accessibility / maintainability expectation>
- [ ] NFR-002. <observability / compatibility expectation>

## Constraints
- <Hard limit: language, framework, target platform, time, must-not-break areas>
- <Must preserve backward compatibility for <surface>>

## Assumptions
- <Belief about the codebase/environment that, if wrong, changes the plan>
- <Assumption is recorded so it can be validated, not silently relied upon>

## Requirement clarification
<!-- Decisions or open questions resolved with the user, if any. -->

## Acceptance criteria
| ID | Criterion | Evidence required |
|---|---|---|
| AC-001 | <observable, testable outcome> | <command output / test name / file diff / screenshot> |
| AC-002 | <observable, testable outcome> | <command output / test name / file diff / screenshot> |
| AC-003 | <observable, testable outcome> | <command output / test name / file diff / screenshot> |

- [ ] OBJ-007. Add/update unit coverage for changed logic.
- [ ] OBJ-008. Add/update Playwright coverage where UI is affected.
- [ ] OBJ-009. Run type/lint/static quality checks (gate commands).
- [ ] OBJ-010. Run targeted and regression tests.
- [ ] OBJ-011. Review implementation against ARCHITECTURE.md and REQ-00x.
- [ ] OBJ-012. Perform security/scope review (SECURITY.md).
- [ ] OBJ-013. Update required documentation/configuration.

## 6. TRACEABILITY.md

```markdown
# Requirement Traceability Matrix

| Objective | Requirement | Test | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OBJ-001 | REQ-001 | `<test cmd / name>` | <output / artifact> | OPEN / DONE |
| OBJ-002 | REQ-002 | `<test cmd / name>` | <output / artifact> | OPEN / DONE |
| OBJ-003 | AC-001  | `<test cmd / name>` | <output / artifact> | OPEN / DONE |

## Rule
No requirement (REQ-/NFR-/AC-) is considered satisfied without evidence.
Every Objective must trace to at least one Requirement and one Evidence entry.
```

## 7. SECURITY.md

```markdown
# Security Audit

## Secrets scan
- Scan command: `<grep/secret-scan cmd>`
- Result: NONE_FOUND / LEAKS_FOUND
- Details: <files/lines if any; never paste the secret value>

## Injection surface
- Untrusted inputs handled: <user input / external content / fetched data>
- Mitigations applied: <validation/escaping/sandboxing>
- External content treated as untrusted: YES / NO

## Authorization (authz) review
- Privilege / permission changes: <none / list + justification>
- Scope violations (changed out-of-scope area): <none / list>
- Destructive operations (rm/force-push/drop): <none / reviewed>

## CRITICAL findings
| ID | Severity | Finding | Evidence | Resolution required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | CRITICAL |  |  |  |

## Block decision
- BLOCK: YES / NO
- Reason: <why the run must not be marked READY>
- Final security status: PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL / BLOCKED
```

## 8. RISK.md

```markdown
# Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RSK-001 | <what could go wrong> | LOW/MED/ HIGH/CRIT | LOW/MED/HIGH/CRIT | <how it is prevented/handled> |
| RSK-002 |  |  |  |  |

## Risk scoring
LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL
High and CRITICAL risks require explicit disposition (mitigated or accepted with reason)
before the run may be marked READY.
```

## 9. research/SOURCES.md

```markdown
# Research Sources

| ID | Source URL | Date accessed | Recency | Trust note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SRC-001 | <https://...> | <YYYY-MM-DD> | <=14d / OLDER | <official docs / vendor blog / community / low-confidence> |
| SRC-002 |  |  |  |  |

## Freshness rule
Prioritize sources from the previous 14 days for current-practice questions.
Older authoritative sources are permitted when necessary but MUST be flagged OLDER.
Record a trust note so downstream decisions carry provenance.
